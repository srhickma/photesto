              <label><b>Our Goal</b></label>
              <docp>Here at Photesto, we believe that as a student, proper preparation and studying is everything. In order to be successful, students must first know what information is important. Currently, all students can do is hope for a half decent set review questions that may or may not even be on the test, quiz, or assignment. The only way to be completely sure you know everything is to simply study every last note you have. This, however, takes a huge amount of time, something students are very short on. It is here that we realized the obvious solution. To know exactly which topics to study, they need only find and study an old version of the test from years past. This would not only give students an idea of what type of questions appearing on their test, but they could also learn and improve from the mistakes of past writers. Finding these old tests, however, is easier said than done. That is where we come in.</docp>
              <docdivider></docdivider>
              <label><b>What We Do</b></label>
              <docp>Once we had a goal it was merely necessary to implement it. To do this, we created Photesto as a database for these old tests, where students can easily search for old tests, quizzes, and assignments to study from, as well as post their old tests to help other students like them. We also implemented features for saving tests you want to study from later, and rating tests depending on how useful or accurate they were. To utilize these features you must first create an account and log in on Photesto, however you can still use Photesto to view and search tests at your will without an account. Since we believe that this resource should be available to all students to keep the playing field level, we decided to make it completely FREE, no strings attatched!</docp>
              <docdivider></docdivider>
              <label><b>What Does It Mean For You?</b></label>
              <docp>By using Photesto, you will have unlimited access to our database of tests everywhere you go just as long as you have an internet connection. When you study from old tests, quizzes, and assignments, you will never have to make another review again! You can save time and only study the material that will actually be on the test, and you can learn from the mistakes and answers of previous students. By using Photesto, you will be able to study much more effectively and thus improve your marks, and you can gain the satisfaction of posting your own tests and helping out fellow students like you. So what are you waiting for? Start using Photesto now!</docp>
              <docdivider></docdivider>
              <label><b>Ethics</b></label>
              <docp>At Photesto, while we do believe that students should have access to old tests as a source of study material, WE DO NOT in any way ENDORSE CHEATING! All tests, quizzes, and assignments posted on Photesto should have already been written and graded, and tests that are yet to be administered should not be posted. Tests and other material posted should also be limited to high school and earlier, and should not include final or mid-term examinations. The goal of this being to avoid any possible accusations of academic misconduct that students could face otherwise.</docp>
